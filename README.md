# Python Learning Exercises

Welcome! 👋  
This repository contains my personal Python programming exercises, created as part of my journey to learn and master Python.

Each folder corresponds to a specific topic or concept — from basic syntax to more advanced structures — with hands-on practice files.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- `01-variables` – Variable declarations, data types, and basic operations  
- `02-conditions` – `if`, `else`, `elif`, and logical expressions  
- `03-loops` – `for` and `while` loops, range, break & continue  
- `04-functions` – Defining and calling functions, parameters, return values  
- `05-lists` – Working with lists, indexing, slicing, and methods  
- `06-dictionaries` – Key-value pairs, dictionary operations  
- `07-strings` – String formatting, manipulation, and methods  
- `08-files` – Reading from and writing to files  
- `09-modules` – Importing modules, using built-in and external libraries  
- *(...and more as I continue learning)*

## ✍️ Purpose

- Practice what I learn after each lesson  
- Improve problem-solving and logic skills  
- Build a solid foundation in Python  
- Track my progress and share it with others

## 📌 Notes

- These are small, focused exercises — not full projects  
- Code is written for learning purposes and may evolve as I improve  
- Feel free to explore or suggest improvements!
